        The world has gotten bigger and every coming year, the amount of resources and energy expended would directly affect the quality of life of the population. Every country, continent or region on the globe have different living environments and circumstances and this plays apart in how the people living in those places go by their every day life.

          Population Density

        <p style="font-size: medium;";">
          From the geographical map shown above, it can be clearly seen that <span style="font-weight:900; font-size:large; color:#1C3185;">China</span> is placed at one of the top countries which has the <span style="font-weight:900; font-size:large; color:#1C3185;">highest population number</span>. A reason of this could be due to the huge amount of arable land which is suitable for agricultural growth, and given the country's history with mass exporting many types of agricultural products such as tea, this has made their economy boom over the years.
          <br></br>
          Other noticeable countries which have a high population density include the <span style="font-weight:900; font-size:large; color:#2253A2;">United States of America</span> as well as <span style="font-weight:900; font-size:large; color:#2253A2;">Brazil</span> These two countries are highly developed regions that are also populated with a high volume of individuals from different cultures and backgrounds.

          GLOBAL GDP per capita
        </h2>
        <p>
          The <b>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</b> measures the monetary value of final goods and services, that is, those that are purchased by users which are produced in a country in a given period of time. Some countries such as the <span style="font-weight:900; font-size:large; color:#A73C03;">United States of America, Australia and Canada</span> were leading in export products sold which led to a positive rise in their state of economy.
          <br></br>
          A deduction that can be made after viewing the map is that <span style="font-weight:900; font-size:large; color:#FEC85D;">lesser developed countries</span> tend to have a lower GDP per capita value compared to those who are much more technologically advantage. This can be seen in regions located in the continent of <span style="font-weight:900; font-size:large; color:#FEC85D;">Africa</span> which have a much lower value of GDP and this could be because of issues such as poverty, government corruption and armed conflict.

        <p>
          This chart represents the distribution of population coming from <span style="font-weight:900; font-size:large;">different age groups and continents</span>. The data shows an increase in the population volume through the coming years and this is makes sense as the number of individuals grow more and more with each generation. From the chart, we can also deduce that the continent of <span style="font-weight:900; font-size:large; color: red"">Africa</span> has the highest number of individuals ranging from the age of 1 to 4 and <span style="font-weight:900; font-size:large; color: #4C78A8">Europe</span> being the one with the lowest.

        <div id="net_migrations"></div>
        <p>
          This chart shows the <span style="font-weight:900; font-size:large;">net number of migrations</span> of each continent across the years. The net migration is the difference number of immigrants (people moving into a given country) and the number of emmigrants (people moving out of the country). Across each continent, there are a few continents that have a <span style="font-weight:900; font-size:large; color: #F68921" >positive change</span> in the number of migrations and these include <span style="font-weight:900; font-size:large; color: #4C78A8">Northern America, Europe and Oceania</span>. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as better opportunities to work, better living conditions, to escape their troubled country or to even get a better education.

          Global crude birth rate and death rate

        <div id="birth_death_rate"></div>
        <p>
          The birth rate in most continents are <span style="font-weight:900; font-size:large; color: #F68921" >much higher</span> than the death rate, with the exception being in Europe where in recent years starting from 2017 and even from the years between 1992 and 2008, the death rate has excceeded the birth rate. This actually results in the increase in population number every passing year as mentioned in the previous sections.
